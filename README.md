# QA RAG app
To run the project use this command

pip install -r requirements.txt

chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh

Please note the dockerfile is not tested as of now since it was giving some issues to run on my local machine

Also, I have used a very small model to generate the response, I tried using meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct on colab and it was giving decently good results.
